# KeyBase organisational model

Resources in KeyBase are scoped at one of three organisational levels:
**KeyBase** (global), **Project**, or **Key**.

- The most important organisational level in KeyBase is the **Project**.
  **Keys**, **Items**, **Sources** and **Filters** are all at the **Project**
  level and are not shared between Projects.

- **Leads** and **Change Notes** belong to a **Key**. Unlike resources at the
  **Project** level, like **Keys** and **Items**, which make sense outside of a
  **Project**'s context, **Leads** and **Change Notes** can only be understood
  within the context of a **Key**.

- **Users** and **Agents** have global scope. They are both handled in the user
  profile. **Agents** in KeyBase are very tightly linked to **Users**. They are
  only used as object of the `createdBy` and `updatedBy` properties on all
  KeyBase resources and not for, _e.g._, authors of Keys and Sources (for which
  we use literals). The reason KeyBase has **Agents** is so that, if a **User**
  account is deleted, all the resources that are created or modified by that
  **User** can stay, as they are linked to the **Agent**, not the **User**.
